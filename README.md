# CMS
CMS  is a web application created with Vue.js, Vuetify, and Vue Router that allows users to manage customer, category, and product data. The application consists of three primary tabs: Customers, Categories, and Products. Each tab displays a table with filter inputs and a button to add a new item. Clicking on a row redirects the user to a view page where they can see the item details and edit or delete it. The application uses a Laravel server and RESTful API for data management.
